## PREVIEW OF APP 
- User is able to login with a unique username and password 

## CHALLENGES AND WINS
- The biggest challenge I faced was managing my time for this project, there was a lot to manage on my own without clearly written iterations like in past projects. Utilizing a project board/ checklist really helped me with this process. 
- The biggest win was getting the API working successfully and being able to get that data back. It was a huge win when everything was working as expected.
